      <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
      <p>
        It is Com2kube's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
        may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to{" "}
        <a href="https://com2kube.io">https://com2kube.io</a> (hereinafter, "us",
        "we", or "https://com2kube.io"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
        protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
        Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain
        what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
        information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to
        third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect
        through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from
        other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
        Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our
        Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
        required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Com2kube collects non-personally-identifying
        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
        available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
        the date and time of each visitor request. Com2kube's purpose in collecting
        non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Com2kube's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, Com2kube may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
        a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Com2kube also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
        comments on https://com2kube.io blog posts. Com2kube only discloses logged in
        user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
        discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Com2kube's websites choose to interact with Com2kube in
        ways that require Com2kube to gather personally-identifying information. The
        amount and type of information that Com2kube gathers depends on the nature of
        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://com2kube.io to provide a username and email address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
        that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
        storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
        to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security.
      </p>
      <h2>Advertisements</h2>
      <p>
        Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
        your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
        information about you or others who use your computer. This information
        allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
        that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers
        the use of cookies by Com2kube and does not cover the use of cookies by any
        advertisers.
      </p>
      <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us.
        If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third
        party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms
        and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.
      </p>
      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        Com2kube may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
        website. Com2kube may display this information publicly or provide it to
        others. However, Com2kube does not disclose your personally-identifying
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Com2kube may change its Privacy
        Policy from time to time, and in Com2kube's sole discretion. Com2kube
        encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
        Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
        Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
